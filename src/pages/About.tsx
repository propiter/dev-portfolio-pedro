          Hello, I'm Pedro ðŸ‘‹
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            I'm a Full Stack Developer passionate about creating impactful and
            scalable web solutions. My journey in development is driven by a
            strong curiosity to understand and build systems that solve
            real-world problems. I've had the privilege of working on diverse
            projects, from automating workflows to building complete CRM systems
            and booking platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in Backend Development, where I craft robust APIs and
            manage relational databases using PostgreSQL. I take pride in
            building scalable solutions that can grow with the business needs.
            For Frontend Development, I focus on creating seamless user
            experiences, using modern tools like React to ensure the interfaces
            are intuitive and visually appealing.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            {" "}
            Additionally, I have experience in Process Automationâ€”streamlining
            workflows and reducing manual tasks using powerful tools like N8N
            and Make. By automating processes, I help businesses improve
            efficiency and free up valuable time for more strategic work.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me creating educational content for
            my YouTube channel, CodeAmigos, where I share tutorials and insights
            about programming and technology. I'm also a firm believer in the
            power of mentorship, actively supporting peers and team members to
            grow their technical skills.
